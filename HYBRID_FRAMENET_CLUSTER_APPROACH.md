# Hybrid FrameNet and Cluster Approach for Soft Logic Vector Reasoning

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for a hybrid approach that combines FrameNet-style semantic frames with clustering-based concept representations to enable advanced analogical reasoning in our soft logic microservice.

## Core Problem Statement

Traditional concept representations in soft logic systems face several limitations:

1. **Static Semantics**: Concepts are often treated as isolated entities without rich relational context
2. **Limited Analogical Reasoning**: Difficulty in finding meaningful analogies across domains
3. **Scalability Issues**: As concept spaces grow, finding related concepts becomes computationally expensive
4. **Context Sensitivity**: Need for dynamic concept interpretation based on situational context

## Hybrid Architecture Design

### 1. FrameNet Integration

**What are Frames?**
- Semantic frames represent structured knowledge about situations, events, or states
- Each frame contains frame elements (semantic roles) that participants can fill
- Example: COMMERCE_BUY frame with elements: Buyer, Seller, Goods, Money

**Our FrameNet Approach:**
```
Frame("Commerce_Buy") {
    elements: [Buyer, Seller, Goods, Money, Place, Time]
    relations: [before(Money, Goods), agent(Buyer), theme(Goods)]
    instances: [FrameInstance with specific concept bindings]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Rich relational context for concepts
- Structured knowledge representation
- Cross-frame analogical reasoning
- Domain-specific semantic understanding

### 2. Clustering Integration

**What is Concept Clustering?**
- Automatic grouping of concepts based on semantic similarity
- Vector embeddings enable distance-based similarity computation
- Hierarchical clustering reveals concept taxonomies

**Our Clustering Approach:**
```
ConceptCluster {
    concepts: [related_concept_1, related_concept_2, ...]
    centroid: computed_vector_representation
    similarity_threshold: 0.8
    cluster_type: semantic_field | domain_specific | analogical
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic concept organization
- Scalable similarity search
- Discovery of unexpected relationships
- Dynamic cluster evolution

### 3. Hybrid Integration Strategy

**Three-Layer Architecture:**

1. **Base Layer: Enhanced Concept Registry**
   - Existing WordNet-integrated concepts
   - Context-aware concept management
   - Synset-based disambiguation

2. **Semantic Layer: Frame-Aware Concepts**
   - Concepts enriched with frame participation
   - Frame element role assignments
   - Cross-frame relationship mapping

3. **Discovery Layer: Cluster-Based Organization**
   - Automatic concept clustering
   - Similarity-based retrieval
   - Analogical mapping discovery

**Integration Points:**

```python
# Example: Frame-aware concept with clustering
concept = FrameAwareConcept(
    base_concept=registry.get_concept("bank", "finance"),
    frame_participations=[
        FrameParticipation(frame="Commerce_Pay", role="Recipient"),
        FrameParticipation(frame="Storage", role="Container")
    ],
    cluster_memberships=[
        ClusterMembership(cluster="financial_institutions", similarity=0.92),
        ClusterMembership(cluster="service_providers", similarity=0.78)
    ]
)
```

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Frame Abstractions (`frame_cluster_abstractions.py`)

**Core Classes:**
- `Frame`: Represents semantic frames with elements and relations
- `FrameElement`: Individual semantic roles within frames
- `FrameInstance`: Specific instantiation of a frame with concept bindings
- `FrameAwareConcept`: Concepts enhanced with frame participation
- `FrameRelation`: Relationships between frames (inheritance, usage, etc.)

### 2. Cluster Abstractions (`frame_cluster_abstractions.py`)

**Core Classes:**
- `ConceptCluster`: Groups of semantically related concepts
- `ClusterMembership`: Concept's membership in clusters with similarity scores
- `AnalogicalMapping`: Mappings between concepts across different domains

### 3. Registry Systems (`frame_cluster_registry.py`)

**Frame Registry:**
- Manage frame definitions and relationships
- Track frame instances and concept bindings
- Support frame-based concept discovery

**Cluster Registry:**
- Manage concept clusters and hierarchies
- Compute and update similarity metrics
- Support cluster-based analogical reasoning

### 4. Hybrid Registry (`hybrid_registry.py`)

**Unified Management:**
- Combine concept, frame, and cluster management
- Provide unified APIs for complex queries
- Support multi-level analogical reasoning

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Level Analogical Reasoning

**Surface-Level Analogies:**
- Direct concept similarity (bank:money :: library:books)
- Based on clustering and vector similarity

**Frame-Level Analogies:**
- Structural similarity across frames
- Role-to-role mappings (buyer→customer, seller→provider)

**Cross-Domain Analogies:**
- Map concepts across different semantic domains
- Example: military_strategy ↔ business_strategy frame mappings

### 2. Dynamic Frame Discovery

**Automatic Frame Extraction:**
- Analyze concept co-occurrence patterns
- Identify potential frame structures from usage
- Propose new frames based on concept relationships

**Frame Evolution:**
- Update frames based on new concept introductions
- Adapt frame elements based on usage patterns
- Learn frame relationships from analogical reasoning

### 3. Context-Sensitive Clustering

**Dynamic Clustering:**
- Clusters adapt based on current context
- Different similarity metrics for different domains
- Temporal clustering evolution

**Multi-Modal Clustering:**
- Combine textual, structural, and usage-based features
- Hierarchical clustering at multiple semantic levels
- Cross-cluster analogical discovery
