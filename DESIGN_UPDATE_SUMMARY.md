## DESIGN_RECOMMENDATIONS.md Update Summary

### Changes Made (July 5, 2025)

#### Status Updates
- **Updated Current Status**: Changed from "Phase 3C+ Persistence Layer Complete" to "Phase 3C Complete, Phase 4 Ready"
- **Added Production Ready Status**: System is now production-ready with full microservice implementation

#### Implementation Review Updates
- **Service Layer Addition**: Added complete FastAPI service layer (1116 lines) with 27 endpoints
- **Test Coverage Update**: Updated from 18 unit tests to 72 total tests (18 core + 20 persistence + 27 service + 2 integration + 5 type safety)
- **Production Features**: Added WebSocket streaming, batch operations, comprehensive error handling

#### Architecture Updates
- **File Structure**: Added service_layer.py and updated test structure
- **Phase 3C Completion**: Moved from "NEXT" to "COMPLETED" status with full feature list
- **Phase 4 Readiness**: Updated Phase 4 from "PLANNED" to "READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION"

#### New Sections Added
