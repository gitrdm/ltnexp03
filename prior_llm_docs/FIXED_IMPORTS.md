# ‚úÖ Fixed: Proper Python Package Structure

## What We Changed

### Before (‚ùå Anti-pattern):
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent / "app"))
from core import Concept, Axiom  # Fragile imports
```

### After (‚úÖ Standard practice):
```python
from app.core import Concept, Axiom  # Clean, standard imports
```

## Why This Is Better

### üéØ **Standard Practice**
- Follows Python packaging conventions
- Uses Poetry's package management properly
- Enables proper `pip install -e .` workflow

### üîß **Developer Experience**  
- **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete, error detection, refactoring
- **Clean Imports**: No more sys.path hacks in every file
- **Reproducible**: Works from any directory, any environment

### üì¶ **Packaging Ready**
- Easy transition to production deployments
- Proper dependency management
- Can be published to PyPI if needed

### üß™ **Testing Benefits**
- Tests work reliably in CI/CD
- No path-dependent test failures
- Better test isolation

## How It Works

1. **pyproject.toml** specifies: `packages = [{include = "app"}]`
2. **poetry install** installs our package in editable mode
3. **Python can import** `app.core` from anywhere
4. **IDE recognizes** the package structure properly

## Commands That Now Work

```bash
# Install in editable mode (once)
poetry install

# Run from anywhere
python demo_abstractions.py
python explore_abstractions.py

# Tests work reliably  
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Clean imports in all files
from app.core import Concept, Axiom
```

## Result: Professional Python Project Structure ‚ú®

Our project now follows industry standards and is ready for:
- Team collaboration
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Production deployment
- Open source distribution
