# FrameNet + Clustering Integration with LTN Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of FrameNet semantic frames and clustering techniques with Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) to create a powerful hybrid reasoning system. The approach combines the structural insights of FrameNet with the flexibility of learned clustering representations to enable sophisticated analogical reasoning and concept understanding.

## Theoretical Foundation

### FrameNet Integration

**Core Concept**: FrameNet provides semantic frames that capture entire scenarios with defined roles and relationships, going beyond simple word-to-word mappings.

**Key Advantages**:
1. **Relational Structure**: Frames capture semantic scenarios with roles (e.g., Commercial_transaction: Buyer, Seller, Goods, Money)
2. **Compositional Reasoning**: Frame hierarchies enable inheritance and specialization
3. **Role-Based Analogies**: Frame elements enable sophisticated analogical reasoning across different domains

### Clustering Integration

**Core Concept**: Clustering techniques provide learned representations where centroids represent emergent concept categories, enabling soft membership and adaptive categorization.

**Key Advantages**:
1. **Learned Representations**: Centroids emerge from data rather than being hand-crafted
2. **Soft Boundaries**: Concepts can belong to multiple clusters with different strengths
3. **Scalability**: Can handle millions of concepts automatically
4. **Adaptability**: Clusters evolve as new data is encountered

## LTN Mathematical Framework

### Frame-Based Logical Structures

```python
# Frame: Commercial_transaction
# Elements: Buyer, Seller, Goods, Money, Time, Place

# LTN Predicates for Frame Structure
Frame_Commercial_transaction = ltn.Predicate("commercial_transaction", 7)  # 7 elements
Buyer = ltn.Predicate("buyer", 2)      # (transaction, entity)
Seller = ltn.Predicate("seller", 2)    # (transaction, entity)
Goods = ltn.Predicate("goods", 2)      # (transaction, item)

# Frame Constraints as LTN Formulas
@ltn.function_of_type(ltn.Domain([2]), ltn.Domain([1]))
def frame_consistency_axiom():
    """Every commercial transaction must have buyer, seller, and goods."""
    return ltn.forall(
        [transaction],
        ltn.implies(
            Frame_Commercial_transaction(transaction, buyer, seller, goods, money, time, place),
            ltn.and_(
                Buyer(transaction, buyer),
                Seller(transaction, seller), 
                Goods(transaction, goods)
            )
        )
    )
```

### Frame Inheritance in LTN

```python
# Frame Hierarchy: Commercial_transaction inherits from Getting
@ltn.function_of_type(ltn.Domain([2]), ltn.Domain([1]))
def frame_inheritance():
    """Commercial transactions are a type of getting event."""
    return ltn.forall(
        [transaction, buyer, seller, goods],
        ltn.implies(
            Frame_Commercial_transaction(transaction, buyer, seller, goods, money, time, place),
            Frame_Getting(transaction, buyer, goods, None, time, place)  # Inherit structure
        )
    )
```

### Soft Cluster Membership in LTN

```python
# Cluster predicates with soft membership
Cluster_0 = ltn.Predicate("cluster_0", 1)  # Animal concepts
Cluster_1 = ltn.Predicate("cluster_1", 1)  # Vehicle concepts  
Cluster_2 = ltn.Predicate("cluster_2", 1)  # Emotion concepts

# Soft membership constraints
@ltn.function_of_type(ltn.Domain([1]), ltn.Domain([1]))
def cluster_membership_axiom():
    """Concepts can belong to multiple clusters with different strengths."""
    return ltn.forall(
        [concept],
        ltn.and_(
            # Total membership should sum to approximately 1
            ltn.equals(
                ltn.add(Cluster_0(concept), Cluster_1(concept), Cluster_2(concept)),
                ltn.constant(1.0),
                tolerance=0.1
            ),
            # All memberships are non-negative
            ltn.greater_equal(Cluster_0(concept), ltn.constant(0.0)),
            ltn.greater_equal(Cluster_1(concept), ltn.constant(0.0)),
            ltn.greater_equal(Cluster_2(concept), ltn.constant(0.0))
        )
    )
```

### Cluster-Based Similarity

```python
@ltn.function_of_type(ltn.Domain([2]), ltn.Domain([1]))
def cluster_similarity():
    """Concepts in same clusters are similar."""
    return ltn.forall(
        [concept1, concept2],
        ltn.implies(
            ltn.greater(
                ltn.dot_product(
                    ltn.concat(Cluster_0(concept1), Cluster_1(concept1), Cluster_2(concept1)),
                    ltn.concat(Cluster_0(concept2), Cluster_1(concept2), Cluster_2(concept2))
                ),
                ltn.constant(0.7)  # High cluster overlap
            ),
            Similar(concept1, concept2)
        )
    )
```

## Hybrid Architecture Design

### Hierarchical Concept Organization

The hybrid approach combines both frame structure and clustering in a unified architecture:

```python
class HierarchicalLTN:
    """LTN with both frame structure and clustering."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Frame-level predicates
        self.frame_predicates = {
            "commercial_transaction": ltn.Predicate("commercial_transaction", 7),
            "motion": ltn.Predicate("motion", 5),
            "communication": ltn.Predicate("communication", 4)
        }
        
        # Cluster-level predicates
        self.cluster_predicates = [
            ltn.Predicate(f"cluster_{i}", 1) for i in range(50)
        ]
        
        # Role-cluster mappings
        self.role_clusters = {
            "agent": [0, 1, 5, 12],      # Clusters containing agent-like concepts
            "patient": [2, 3, 8, 15],    # Clusters containing patient-like concepts
            "instrument": [10, 11, 20]   # Clusters containing instrument-like concepts
        }
```

### Cross-Frame Analogical Reasoning

```python
def cross_frame_analogy_with_clusters():
    """Analogies work across frames when roles have similar cluster patterns."""
    return ltn.forall(
        [concept1, concept2, frame1, frame2, role1, role2],
        ltn.implies(
            ltn.and_(
                # Same role names across different frames
                ltn.equals(role1, role2),
                
                # Concepts fill these roles in respective frames
                Role_in_frame(concept1, frame1, role1),
                Role_in_frame(concept2, frame2, role2),
                
                # Concepts have similar cluster patterns
                Cluster_similarity(concept1, concept2, threshold=0.8)
            ),
            # Then concepts are analogous in these roles
            Analogous_in_role(concept1, concept2, role1)
        )
    )
```

## Multi-Level Loss Function

```python
def hybrid_loss_function(predictions, ground_truth):
    """Combined loss for frame + cluster learning."""
    
    # Frame-level consistency loss
    frame_loss = ltn.satisfaction_level(frame_consistency_axioms)
    
    # Cluster-level coherence loss  
    cluster_loss = ltn.satisfaction_level(cluster_similarity_axioms)
    
    # Cross-level alignment loss
    alignment_loss = ltn.satisfaction_level(frame_cluster_consistency_axioms)
    
    # Analogical reasoning loss
    analogy_loss = ltn.satisfaction_level(cross_frame_analogy_axioms)
    
    # Weighted combination
    total_loss = (0.3 * frame_loss + 
                 0.2 * cluster_loss + 
                 0.3 * alignment_loss + 
                 0.2 * analogy_loss)
    
    return total_loss
```

3. **Learnable Representations**: Both frame assignments and cluster memberships can be learned from data
4. **Compositional Generalization**: New concepts can be understood through both frame roles and cluster patterns
5. **Uncertainty Handling**: Soft memberships allow concepts to partially belong to multiple frames/clusters

## Technical Challenges

1. **Computational Complexity**: Managing both frame constraints and cluster computations efficiently
2. **Data Requirements**: Need sufficient training data for both frame assignment and cluster learning
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Balancing frame vs. cluster influences in the loss function
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing appropriate metrics for hybrid reasoning quality
5. **Interpretability**: Maintaining explainability while leveraging learned representations

## Conclusion

The hybrid FrameNet + Clustering approach represents a significant advancement in soft logic reasoning systems. By combining the structural insights of FrameNet with the adaptability of clustering techniques, we can create a system that is both theoretically grounded and practically effective for complex reasoning tasks.

The integration with LTN provides a principled mathematical framework for combining these approaches, enabling end-to-end learning while maintaining logical consistency and interpretability.
