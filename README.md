**Personal experimentation platform for combining symbolic reasoning with neural learning** - this platform integrates FrameNet-style semantic frames, clustering-based concept organization, neural training with LTNtorch, and hard logic verification with Z3 SMT solver. This platform was built using a LLM as a coding partner as part of the research into development of a project of this kind. The use of a LLM includes generation of the docs and the claims in this readme. However, I do not know if the project works as intended or what kind of bugs remain, so use at your own risk.

## 🎯 Quick Start Examples

### Basic Concept Creation and Analogical Reasoning
```python
from app.core.enhanced_semantic_reasoning import EnhancedHybridRegistry

# Create registry with hybrid reasoning capabilities
registry = EnhancedHybridRegistry()

# Create concepts with automatic embeddings
registry.create_concept("king", context="royalty", description="Male monarch")
registry.create_concept("queen", context="royalty", description="Female monarch")
registry.create_concept("man", context="person", description="Adult male")
registry.create_concept("woman", context="person", description="Adult female")

# Train clustering system
registry.train_clustering()

# Find analogical completions: king:queen :: man:?
completions = registry.complete_analogy({"king": "queen", "man": "?"})
print(f"Analogical completion: {completions}")  # Should suggest "woman"
```

### Neural Training with LTNtorch
```python
from app.core.neural_symbolic_integration import NeuralSymbolicTrainingManager

# Initialize neural-symbolic training
manager = NeuralSymbolicTrainingManager()

# Configure training parameters
config = TrainingConfiguration(
    learning_rate=0.01,
    batch_size=32,
    epochs=100,
    device="auto"  # Automatically detects GPU/CPU
)

# Start training with real-time progress
async for progress in manager.train_with_streaming(concepts, config):
    print(f"Epoch {progress.epoch}: Loss = {progress.loss:.4f}")
```

### SMT Verification of Logic Constraints
```python
from app.core.neural_symbolic_integration import Z3SMTVerifier

# Create logical axioms
axioms = [
    "∀x: (King(x) → Male(x))",           # Kings are male
    "∀x: (Queen(x) → Female(x))",        # Queens are female  
    "∀x: ¬(Male(x) ∧ Female(x))"        # Nothing is both male and female
]

# Verify consistency with Z3
verifier = Z3SMTVerifier()
result = verifier.verify_axiom_consistency(axioms)
print(f"Axioms are consistent: {result.is_consistent}")
```
