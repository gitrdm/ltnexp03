# Core Abstractions Summary

## âœ… What We've Built (Phase 1 Complete)

### 1. Core Data Structures

**Concept Class** (`app/core/abstractions.py`)
- Represents individual concepts with optional WordNet synset disambiguation
- Handles context-specific naming (e.g., "bank" in finance vs geography)
- Automatic name normalization and unique ID generation
- Full equality and hashing support

**FormulaNode Class** (`app/core/abstractions.py`)
- Tree-based representation of logical formulas
- Supports operations: ADD, SUBTRACT, SIMILARITY, DISSIMILARITY
- Recursive concept extraction from nested formulas
- Validation of operation argument counts

**Axiom Class** (`app/core/abstractions.py`)
- Represents logical relationships between concepts
- Type hierarchy: ANALOGY, SYNONYM, ANTONYM, SIMILARITY, etc.
- Core vs Soft classification for SMT/LTN routing
- Automatic concept extraction from formulas

**Context Class** (`app/core/abstractions.py`)
- Manages collections of axioms and concepts
- Supports inheritance (parent contexts)
- Separates core vs soft axioms for different processing
- Context-specific concept lookup

### 2. File Format Support

**AxiomParser Class** (`app/core/parsers.py`)
- Parses both JSON and YAML axiom definition files
- Handles complex nested formulas
- Automatic concept registry management
- Robust error handling and validation

**Supported File Formats:**
- YAML: Human-friendly, great for manual editing
- JSON: Machine-friendly, great for APIs and databases

### 3. WordNet Integration

**ConceptRegistry Class** (`app/core/concept_registry.py`)
- Optional WordNet integration for synset disambiguation
- Context-aware concept management
- Pattern-based concept search
- Homonym handling (bank_financial vs bank_river)
- Automatic concept creation with disambiguation

### 4. Testing & Validation

**Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/test_core/test_abstractions.py`)
- 18 unit tests covering all core functionality
- Tests for concept equality, formula validation, axiom parsing
- Context management and concept registry functionality
- All tests passing âœ…

## ðŸ”§ Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Concept Disambiguation**
```python
# Financial bank
bank_financial = registry.create_concept(
    "bank", "finance", synset_id="bank.n.01", 
    disambiguation="financial institution"
)

# River bank  
bank_river = registry.create_concept(
    "bank", "geography", synset_id="bank.n.09",
    disambiguation="land beside water"
)
```

### 2. **Complex Formula Construction**
```python
# Gender analogy: king - man + woman â‰ˆ queen
analogy_formula = FormulaNode(
    operation=OperationType.SIMILARITY,
    args=[
        FormulaNode(
            operation=OperationType.ADD,
            args=[
                FormulaNode(OperationType.SUBTRACT, [king, man]),
                woman
            ]
        ),
        queen
    ]
)
```

### 3. **Context-Aware Management**
```python
# Create context with multiple axioms
context = Context("word_analogies", description="...")
context.add_axiom(gender_axiom)
context.add_axiom(synonym_axiom)

# Separate core vs soft axioms
core_axioms = context.get_core_axioms()  # For SMT verification
soft_axioms = context.get_soft_axioms()  # For LTN training
```

### 4. **File Format Support**
```yaml
# YAML format - human friendly
axiom_id: gender_analogy
type: analogy
classification: core
description: "Gender analogy: king is to man as queen is to woman"
formula:
  similarity:
    left:
      add:
        - subtract: [king, man]
        - woman
    right: queen
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Example Output

The demo script successfully created and managed:
- **10 concepts** across 5 contexts (royal, transport, weather, finance, geography)
- **4 axioms** of different types (analogy, synonym, antonym, dissimilarity)
- **Homonym handling** for "bank" with different meanings
- **Pattern matching** for concept discovery
- **Context-specific retrieval** working correctly

## ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 2

The abstractions are now ready for the next phase:

1. **SMT Integration** - Core axioms can be sent to Z3 for consistency checking
2. **LTN Integration** - Soft axioms can be sent to LTNtorch for embedding learning
3. **API Layer** - REST endpoints can work with these standardized data structures
4. **Persistence** - Save/load functionality for contexts and models

## ðŸ§ª How to Explore

Run the exploration scripts:
```bash
# Basic functionality tour
python explore_abstractions.py

# Comprehensive demo
python demo_abstractions.py

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/test_core/test_abstractions.py -v
```

The foundation is solid and ready for building the SMT verification and LTN training systems on top of it!
